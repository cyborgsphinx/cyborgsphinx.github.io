The Raven Queen
---------------

The Raven Queen is the goddess of fate and death.
She is relatively new to godhood, and many are unsure about her.
However, she seems for the most part content with shepparding the dead on their way to the afterlife,
occasionally taking interest in the journey of especially powerful mortals.

She strongly opposes any attempts to thwart fate,
particularly attempts to prolong life unnaturally.
The undead are seen as a plague that must be purged from the multiverse.
As such, Chemosh and Orcus are among her most hated foes.

Chemosh
-------

Chemosh is the god of the undead.
He has been reduced in power in recent years through the efforts of the Raven Queen and her followers,
though the Cult of Gulthias intends to help him regain his power.
He uses Orcus to further his goals on the multiverse until he can stand against the Matron of Ravens once again.

Bahamut
-------

Bahamut is the dragon god of good and metalic dragons.
He is among the oldest of the gods,
having bound Tiamat to the Nine Hells in order to restrict her power.

Tiamat
------

Tiamat is the goddess of evil and chromatic dragons.
She was born at the same time as Bahamut,
though her deeds have led to her being bound to the first layer of the Nine Hells without an escape.

a race that has a more established presence along the coasts.
