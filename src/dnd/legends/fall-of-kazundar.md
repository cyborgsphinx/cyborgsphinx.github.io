title: The Fall of Kazundar
...

The following is told from a dwarven perspective

In a time long past, Kazundar was among the most prosperous kingdom Thune had ever seen.
Ruled out of Magleth, inside Thunderclap Mountain, it was the kingdom the dwarves had crafted while the elves were busy guarding planar gates and the humans were still arguing over which end of the sword was the handle.
Even the dragonborn were still just a loose collective of clans back then, not the great empire rising in the south they are now.
This was the time of the forge.

Professions were sill about the craft, about the quality of the product, not how many tables can be made in a day.
And it showed in the capitol.
Magleth was an amazing city, carved out of the mountain like it had always been there, waiting to be discovered.
We expanded ever upward and downward, constantly making room for the populace that wanted to live in the best city in the world.

Our trade routes were well guarded too.
No bandits anywhere within the influence of Kazundar, at least not long enough to make it worth anyone's while.
You could walk from one side of the kingdom to the other and never see the business and of an axe.
It's amazing what can be done with a trained and funded army.

Olladria was once under our influence, wouldn't you know.
That's why it's such a great place for trade now - the city still remembers how to be run.

Some hundred years ago, the life seemed to get sucked out of the earth.
Plants stopped growing, beasts stopped living, even the dirt slowly turned to inert, black sand.
Only thing not turning into dust was Thunderclap Mountain itself.
Magleth was safe, not so much the rest of Kazundar.
Olladira is too far away to feel the effects, so far.
This desert seems hungry, though.
It just keeps growing.

We had to retreat into Magleth in order to survive, only place we knew was safe.
There isn't infinite space inside a mountain, though, so not everyone could come.

Notes
-----

- They tried many different things to cultivate the earth, to make things grow
- They searched for the cause, finding very little information about any similar events
- Expand on retreat into Magleth: "The gates were sealed in the face of a great many hungry dwarves"
