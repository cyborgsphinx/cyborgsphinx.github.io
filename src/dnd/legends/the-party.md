title: The Party
...

The Party was a group of adventurers who traveled throughout the continent of Thune.
They fought dragons, felled empires, and still managed to help out small townsfolk in any city they visited.
The people loved them, the tyrants feared them, it seemed that all was right in the world as long as they stayed around.
Their faces changed as the years went by, a fallen dwarf replaced by a gnome, an aging human making room for a fresh-faced elf.
But the name remained, for every member kept true to the values of the original group.

At one point, they even challenged the ascent of Vecna to godhood, saving the entire multiverse from what could only have been centuries of conflict.
In the process, they freed an immortal from being Vecna's slave, but they could not break the curse forcing her to follow any command given.

It is said that they could only be defeated by a god, who caused a rock slide which crushed not only them but the entire city beneath Mount Grimm.
Some believe that The Party endures to this day, however, since the bodies were never recovered from the base of the mountain.
