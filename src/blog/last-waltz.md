So I "Learned" How to Waltz
===========================

*9 July 2016*
-------------

I recently learned how to waltz with a few hundred of my close personal friends in downtown Vancouver.
I say learned, but it's only really learned if writing Hello World and Fizz Buzz means you've learned programming.
I now know how a waltz generally works, and can (probably) not look like a complete idiot if it ever comes up again, but I'm nowhere near putting it on my CV.
It was fun, though.
