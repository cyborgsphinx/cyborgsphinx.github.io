Thoughts on Parentheses
=======================

*1 July 2016*

Some people seem to not like parentheses.
In fact, they seem absolutely terrified of them.
I don't understand why.

Parentheses are very good at being visual short hand for grouping objects.
In fact, that is their entire purpose.
Just group things.
So it is natural to want to use them when you want to group things.
As natural as reaching for a hammer to force nails into wood, anyway.
By which I mean that you have to know about them and their job before hand.
But once you know that, it only makes sense to want to use the tool for its intended purpose.

Which is why point-free style surprises me.
It is unnecessary.
Parentheses exist so that there is a universal way to indicate that a group of things is separate from any other group of things.
Introducing new syntax just to avoid parentheses is pointless.
Maybe that's why it's called point-free.

It's possible that the creators of this got scared by Lisp.
Maybe they didn't have an editor that can highlight matching parentheses.
So, like, Nano or something.
