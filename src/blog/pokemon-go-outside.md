Pokemon Go as a Motivation App
==============================

*8 Aug 2016*

Some people have no problem finding motivation.
Often their motivation is intrinsic; they simply enjoy doing what they're supposed to.
Other people have more trouble finding the motivation, even if it's something they want to do.
These are not mutually exclusive, as one person's motivation can be very different between different actions.

I have long had difficulty finding motivation to go outside and exercise.
Even when I want to, even when I know I'll enjoy it, it can be hard to find the right motivation at the right time to do it.
Enter Pokemon Go.
It has given me a reason to do exactly what I want to be doing anyway.

It's not that I want to stay inside and stare at screens all day.
In fact, I know that's not good for me.
But I couldn't motivate myself to go out very easily before.
It's easier when I can use that to do something else I'll enjoy.
Like collecting Pokemon.

If only it didn't come out in the latter half of the semester, when I needed to focus on all my assignments.
Oh well, better late than never, right?
