Some Thoughts About Limitations
===============================

*25 May 2016*

Mark Rosewater, head designer for Magic the Gathering, likes to say that limitations breed creativity.
Or something like that.
I can't seem to find a source on that one for some reason.

But anyway, limitations.
I'm somewhat skeptical of this notion, not just because I generally dislike limiting myself.
It is my experience that creativity is spontaneously generated, and that everything after the spark is just hard work.
What some see as creativity may just be testing the limits given and trying to come up with some solution that fits.

Limitatins do have value, however.
If they didn't it's likely that we wouldn't put them on everything.
The benefit given my limitations, however, is more about getting results.
If you have a limit, whether on time or content or something else entirely, it is easier for you to present some sort of result.
This is why exams and assignments have time limits.
If there was no limit, the eventual result would possibly be the most creative product possible.
However, it is just as likely that it never sees the light of day.

Limitations remove the problem some people have with a blank canvas or an empty page.
Those represent all possible outcomes, and anything is possible when they stay that way.
But when some constraint is put on them, it makes it easier to move forward with a particular project.

This is why most people try to come up with some constraint for any project where the instructor gives none; we all know it's easier to move forward when some decisions have already been made.
It is certainly harder to keep comeing up with content for a blog that has no set content requirements.
I just like keeping my options open, especially when I can easily get bored of topics.
