IDEs Just Get In The Way
========================

*17 May 2016*
--------------

I'm not a fan of IDEs.
They don't do it for me.
There's nothing they can do that can't be done by something else, and the other offering is often at least more flexible.

Editing code is easy if you understand the editor you're using.
This is true of IDEs as well, but they're often so big and bulky that it's harder to learn just the editing bits.
Having a light-weight editor that just wants to let you write to a file is good because it allows the programmer's own style and influence come across.
In an IDE with code generation, this can get lost in the noise.
As well, it is hard to generate code that works the first time, every time.
This is why compilers are still complex things that few people want to work on.
Introducing that amount of complexity into editing text seems like overkill for most things.

IDEs tend to be less portable than editors, too.
What you learn in an IDE is often specific to that IDE, and your configuration can't travel with you either.
They also expect projects and directories to be built in specific ways, that often are unique to the IDE itself.

Overall, I find IDEs to be incredibly difficult to work with, and wind up just making it harder to do what I wanted to.
Except ones made by JetBrains.
Those guys know what they're doing when it comes to making an IDE that gets out of the way.
