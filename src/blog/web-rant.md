Websites Suck
=============

That title was just to get your attention.
I don't actually think websites suck.
I do think making them does, especially for those starting out.

You've got HTML, which is decent enough, but not good for straight up writing text in.
That's why Markdown was made, after all.
Then there's CSS, which is only necessary for websites as much as scoreboards are for sporting events.
Technically optional, unless you're planning on having actual people actually show up.
So you need to know how to CSS, or at least use a framework like Bootstrap.
But if you use Bootstrap, you wind up with a site that looks like it uses Boostrap.
Since every startup since the creation of Bootstrap uses Bootstrap (slight hyperbole, I'm sure some use Foundation), that means your site looks like every other site.
And everyone's tired of looking at that.

Finally, there's everyone's favourite part of the web trifecta: Javascript.
Like CSS, you don't NEED it.
Unlike CSS, I don't use it here.
To carry on with the sports analogy, Javascript is like having a unique symbol for your team.
Cool if you have it, but it won't hurt not to.
Since I don't use it, I have less to say about it.
I mostly just dislike it on principle.
