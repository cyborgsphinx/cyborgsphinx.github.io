My Operating System is Too Easy
===============================

*2 July 2016*
-------------

Since the beginning of the summer, I have been running Ubuntu 16.04 as my main Linux environment.
And I must say, it's getting pretty boring.

I started my dive into Linux and Unix with Fedora, the community offering by Red Hat.
Eventually, I moved to Arch, a DIY distro that assumes nothing about its users.
And after years of those being how I interact with my computer, Ubuntu just feels boring.

The only I've updated in the past week has been NeoVim, which I got through a PPA.
The Unity desktop environment is good enough to do mostly what I want a full DE to do.
I haven't bothered with really setting up a tiling window manager, because I have better things to do with my time.
But that's the thing - just last year, that WAS what I wanted to spend my time on.

This summer, I am pretty busy.
Three courses during a time when I am normally taking none will do that.
So I really shouldn't be spending a lot of time on tweaking my environment anyway.
But I'm so used to doing it that it feels weird not to.

The only problem I've run into has been difficulty with installing Steam.
But I haven't purged my machine of Windows yet, so that's not really an issue either.
