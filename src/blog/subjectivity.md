Objective Facts and Why Your Opinion is Not One
===============================================

*3 June 2016*

My high school music teacher impressed upon us one very important fact in the first class: You don't know enough to know whether music is good or not.
Any time someone says that a song is "bad" or even that a genre "sucks", they are expressing their subjective opinion as if it were a fact.
It is not a fact.
They likely don't know enough about music to actually know whether or not anything is technically good.
All they can tell is whether or not they like it.

This comes up in technical circles more than I would like.
People spout their opinions on programming languages or frameworks or paradigms as though they are objective fact despite being solely opinion.
These opinions may not even be those of the people expressing them.
I've come across people who will express an opinion but have no real reason to back it up.
I've even had that happen to me.
And It is often because these people just took someone else's opinion and decided to roll with it.
Then they have this opinion that they will defend to the death without having any idea why.

I'd love to offer a solution to this, but I can't come up with one outside of "actually understand the difference between fact an opinion".
Which would definitely solve the issue, but it isn't exactly easy to do.
