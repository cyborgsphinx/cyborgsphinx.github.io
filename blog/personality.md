Some Thoughts on Personality
============================

*12 June 2016*

I come from a family of introverts.
Growing up, I was told, by this family, that I was incredibly extroverted.
I never saw myself that way, and passed it off as the effect of only being able to judge these things relatively.

More recently, I've started to see myself as more extroverted than I had previously.
Still not exactly an extrovert, but somewhere in the middle.
An ambivert, if you will.
And it's possible that what I saw previously as solid intrversion was realy just depression making it hard to want to be extroverted.
Maybe depressed extroverts present as introverts.

That's all I really have to say.
No big revelation.
We all know personality classifications are little more than horoscopes anyway.
