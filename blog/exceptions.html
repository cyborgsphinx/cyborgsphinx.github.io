    <h1>Thoughts On Exception Hnadling</h1>
    <h2><em>30 May 2016</em></h2>
    <p>When I first came across expetions and the things that
    surround them, I wasn't a fan. To be fair, that was because it
    was new and, like most other people, I didn't like new things.
    I've since had time to think about how exception handling works
    and why it might exist, and I still don't like it.</p>
    <p>As far as I can tell, exception handling exists because how
    errors are handled in C is not great. No way to tell which
    functions might fail, have to include a header to get any real
    information out of it, stuff like that. It's really not a great
    way to go about handling errors.</p>
    <p>Since the type system wasn't incredibly powerful back then,
    the idea came around that functions could throw exceptions,
    like the computer itself does. So all you need to do is wrap
    your function in a <code>try</code> block, toss in a
    <code>catch</code> block corresponding to the error that can be
    thrown, and you're good to go. Put your error handling code in
    the <code>catch</code>, anything that needs to go with the
    fallible function in the <code>try</code>, and move on. No
    importing another header. No checking a global variable that
    can potentially be modified in another thread. Sounds pretty
    good.</p>
    <p>Except how large should the <code>try</code> block be?
    Should you put your entire function in one large block, and
    catch all the errors in succeeding <code>catch</code>es? Or
    should you put as little as possible in a single
    <code>try</code>, and only <code>catch</code> the errors from
    that block? I'm in favour of the second, personally.</p>
    <p>I'm in favour of it because it is closer to the method I
    prefer, which is for errors to be imbedded in the return of the
    function, like in Go and Rust. Go supports multiple returns,
    allowing for returning an error value along side the value
    expected, and the programmer is supposed to handle it
    themselves. Rust has entire types dedicated to possible
    failures, made possible by algrbraic data types, which again
    must be handled before the value can be used. This method makes
    it clear which functions can fail, which helps future readers
    of the code. I believe that code should be for the reader, with
    the compiler taking care of optimizations wherever
    possible.</p>
    <p>In light of this, I don't mind exception handling when done
    in the second way for the same reason; code is for the reader,
    and having <code>try</code> wrapping as little as possible
    gives more information to the reader. However, I do believe
    that exception handling is a red flag. It is an indication that
    the programming language is not built in such a way that error
    handling can be done gracefully by simply returning a
    value.</p>
