  Amazed at Yacc</h1>
  <h2 id="june-2016"><em>17 June 2016</em></h2>
  <p>I was told today that were I around writing compilers in the
  70’s, I would be grateful for Yacc. This came up because I was
  complaining about yacc within earshot of someone who knows what
  they’re talking about. And I don’t doubt it. The thing is, this
  isn’t the 70’s. And I don’t know context-free grammars as well as
  I probably should. But I am trying to use yacc, so I would like
  it if yacc produced warnings more useful than “this rule is
  useless” without any context. I know it’s a context-free grammar,
  but still. I would at least like to know why this warning was
  produced, so I can write rules that are a little bit useful.</p>
  <p>If you say my rules are useless, I’m assuming you know why. If
  you tell me why, I can make rules that are less useless. Even if
  I know exactly what I’m doing, it is likely that I put that rule
  in because I expected it to be useful, so telling me why it’s
  useless is a benefit anyway.</p>
