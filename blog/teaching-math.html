  Think How We Teach Math Is Crazy</h1>
  <h2 id="june-2016"><em>16 June 2016</em></h2>
  <p>I’ve heard people complain about how we teach math to kids.
  Some even think that using more abstract concepts will help.
  After all, kids can grasp calculus better than adults apparently.
  But I think teaching math the way they did when they taught me
  makes some sense, and has value. And that’s not just because
  that’s how I was taught.</p>
  <p>You see, when we teach math by starting with natural numbers
  and adding, we emulate the first people who had to add up their
  sheep and make sure none ran away. Then we toss in subtraction -
  but only subtracting a smaller number from a bigger number - and
  it’s like those people trying to figure out how many ran off.
  Eventually we’ll move on to multiplication, so that we can make
  sure that the guy selling sheep doesn’t rip us off or whatever,
  and to do that you may as well be able to do it in your head.
  Machines are falible, after all. But in order to really use
  multiplication, we need to introduce negative numbers. I think
  they get introduced before multiplication, but order isn’t all
  that important to the story I’m trying to tell. Point is,
  negative numbers. They’re not real things, because a negative
  sheep doesn’t make any sense, but they’re useful when currency is
  introduced in order to represent debt. So now we have
  multiplication and negative numbers, and we’ve moved beyond just
  people in hills counting sheep for whatever reason.</p>
  <p>Since we have multiplication, we might as well create its
  opposite. Opposite operations are useful, after all. So we get
  division, but you can’t just talk about integers forever.
  Sometimes remainders aren’t useful, and you want an even split.
  Enter fractions.</p>
  <p>By the way, we often teach fractions all wrong. Fractions are
  division. Put parentheses around the top and bottom of a
  fraction, and once you resolve those expressions what remains is
  just dividing the top by the bottom. Not sure why we can’t just
  tell people that, but it might have to do with the history lesson
  we’re also getting - people just didn’t make the connection for a
  while.</p>
  <p>So now we have the four primary operations found on every
  calculator and every useful programming language. Time to get
  silly.</p>
  <p>By the time we figured out division and fractions, cities had
  probably grown to the point where not everything had to revovle
  around making sure you counted sheep right. There was time that
  could be spent elsewhere; specifically, time could be spent
  thinking about arithmetic. I’m not sure what time we’re at in
  relation to geometry, but arithmetic starts talking about
  exponents eventually. Since this is the part in the story I’ve
  invented where math gets taken over by academics, the implicit
  history lesson kind of stops.</p>
  <p>Another important part of this view, however, is that it
  explains why we constantly make assertions that are ignored down
  the line. It turns out you can subtract large numbers from
  smaller numbers, as long as you account for it with negative
  numbers. It turns out you can divide a small number by a bigger
  number, as long as you allow for fractions and rational numbers.
  These are still taught not just because they make the mental load
  easier, allowing kids to focus on one concept, but also because
  at one point, that was what we knew. We didn’t know about
  negative numbers for a while, so we couldn’t subtract 5 from 2.
  We didn’t know about rational numbers, so we couldn’t divide 4 by
  7. Now we do, but that doesn’t erase the past.</p>
  <p>All of this is lost when we try to teach kids how to do this
  with sets. This, and the attention of the kids.</p>
