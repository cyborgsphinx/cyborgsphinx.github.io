Mass Effect 3 Ending
====================

Before playing Mass Effect 3, I had heard that the ending was a let down.
Recently, I finished it and found the ending to fit well within the story.

If you didn't already know, Mass Effect 3 is a video game.
As you may have guessed, it is the third game in a series, whose title is Mass Effect.
At its core, the game is about choices.
Hard choices.
The kind of choices we don't want to have to make.
Peppered throughout are choices that are easier to make, and generally have to do with playing a role the player has in their head.
However, now and then a much larger choice comes along, and forces the player to really sit down and think about what they're doing.

One such choice is whether to destroy or modify some synthetic life forms who have formed beliefs based on a floating point rounding error.
That was an acutal thing in an actual game.
But the choice itself is basically between changing some living beings so that they think in a way that you want them to, or killing them.
Neither option really appeals.
But this choice is there, and it's practically designed to be divisive.
It's a significant moral dilemma - do you kill someone for not believing what you do, or do you change their mind without them knowing or wanting you to?
It should be mentioned at this point that leaving them alone is not really an option.
Not only because the game won't let you, but also because they have become violent due to their beliefs and have attacked those who disagree.
So something needs to be done, otherwise innocent people will get hurt.

The choice in the ending to Mass Effect 3 is fairly well related to the one above.
Briefly, a race of overpowered synthetic life forms called Reapers are threatening to destroy all advanced life in the galaxy, and you can stop them in one of three ways:

- Destroy: you can destroy not only them, but all synthetic life in the galaxy,
- Control: you can assume direct control over the machines threatening harm,
- Synthesis: you can make every living thing in the galaxy a hybrid of synthetic and organic life.

These all have their own moral dilemmas, but again not choosing isn't really an option because of the intent of the Reapers.
I'm not going to say which one is best, because they can all be backed by good reasons, at least from the point of view of the player character.
However, I think this kind of ending fits well within the Mass Effect series due to its difficulty to answer well.

Personally, I think synthesis is the best solution to the problem.
