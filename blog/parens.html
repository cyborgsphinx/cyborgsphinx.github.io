    <h1>Thoughts on Parentheses</h1>
    <h2><em>1 July 2016</em></h2>
    <p>Some people seem to not like parentheses. In fact, they seem
    absolutely terrified of them. I don't understand why.</p>
    <p>Parentheses are very good at being visual short hand for
    grouping objects. In fact, that is their entire purpose. Just
    group things. So it is natural to want to use them when you
    want to group things. As natural as reaching for a hammer to
    force nails into wood, anyway. By which I mean that you have to
    know about them and their job before hand. But once you know
    that, it only makes sense to want to use the tool for its
    intended purpose.</p>
    <p>Which is why point-free style surprises me. It is
    unnecessary. Parentheses exist so that there is a universal way
    to indicate that a group of things is separate from any other
    group of things. Introducing new syntax just to avoid
    parentheses is pointless. Maybe that's why it's called
    point-free.</p>
    <p>It's possible that the creators of this got scared by Lisp.
    Maybe they didn't have an editor that can highlight matching
    parentheses. So, like, Nano or something.</p>
