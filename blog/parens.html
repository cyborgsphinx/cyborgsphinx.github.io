  <p>Some people seem to not like parentheses. In fact, they seem
  absolutely terrified of them. I don’t understand why.</p>
  <p>Parentheses are very good at being visual short hand for
  grouping objects. In fact, that is their entire purpose. Just
  group things. So it is natural to want to use them when you want
  to group things. As natural as reaching for a hammer to force
  nails into wood, anyway. By which I mean that you have to know
  about them and their job before hand. But once you know that, it
  only makes sense to want to use the tool for its intended
  purpose.</p>
  <p>Which is why point-free style surprises me. It is unnecessary.
  Parentheses exist so that there is a universal way to indicate
  that a group of things is separate from any other group of
  things. Introducing new syntax just to avoid parentheses is
  pointless. Maybe that’s why it’s called point-free.</p>
  <p>It’s possible that the creators of this got scared by Lisp.
  Maybe they didn’t have an editor that can highlight matching
  parentheses. So, like, Nano or something.</p>
