    <h1>Why I Don't Think Programming Languages Should Read Like
    English</h1>
    <h2><em>12 June 2016</em></h2>
    <p>Anybody successfully reading this must understand English. I
    say this because it is written in English. A common idea in
    programming language design that I've started hearing more of
    recently is having the language read like English. I think this
    is a bad idea. I think it is a bad idea for one primary reason:
    I think English is a bad language.</p>
    <p>English is hard to learn. Ask anyone for whom it is a second
    language. Unless the world has changed, English is ranked as
    one of the hardest languages to learn known to humans. This is
    because, at least in part, English is arbitrary. It has no
    governing body, it was not designed. English has become what it
    is today through an evolutionary process of constant change.
    Even today, English is changing. Many people don't like how it
    is changing, but it is changing nonetheless. And these changes
    are made by groups of people coming together and deciding that
    they will communicate a little differently. This is happening
    now mostly with the text-based form, focused on punctuation,
    but it is happening. So trying to emulate English is going to
    be hard, because English is arbitrary and chaotic.</p>
    <p>But even if we used another language as the target, I don't
    think it would help. Some of the things that come out of this
    may be useful, like using a parameter name in a function call
    to represent what the parameter is, but that's not because it's
    more like English. A very similar effect can be achived simply
    with descriptive variable names and no magic numbers. As an
    example, one might make a function <code>join()</code> which
    takes three strings and joins the first two with the second
    inbetween. To keep things straight, proponents of programming
    languages being like English would suggest it look something
    like <code>join("foo", to: "bar", with: ",");</code> which
    would produce <code>"foo,bar"</code>. I would put forth that
    this kind of code, where it is clear what each part does just
    by looking, is already available:</p>
    <p><code>first = "foo"; second = "bar"; separator = ",";
    join(first, second, separator);</code></p>
    <p>So it doesn't really get us anywhere to suggest the first,
    in my opinion.</p>
    <p>Yes, that was a contrived example. But the idea of what I'm
    getting at is still clear.</p>
    <p>Another thing that comes out of having code read like
    English is having many ways to do one thing, which is its own
    incredibly contentious subject in and of itself. But this is my
    blog, so I'll spout my opinions on it anyway. There exists in
    Ruby the keyword <code>unless</code>, which as far as I can
    tell is exactly the same as <code>if not</code>. It takes up
    the same number of keystrokes, it isn't any more clear, and it
    adds to the number of keywords in the language. As far as I'm
    concerned, it doesn't help make the language any better. So I
    question its existence in a world where both <code>if</code>
    and <code>not</code> are things that can easily be used, and
    can also apply in other areas. There's also the
    <code>&lt;statement&gt; if &lt;expression&gt;</code> construct,
    which is functionally equivalent to <code>if &lt;expression&gt;
    then &lt;statement&gt; end</code>, and not much easier to
    unerstand. Especially since you have to mentally change the
    context of <code>&lt;statement&gt;</code> after having already
    read it. It's a way to hide what's actually going on, but it
    reads more like English so it's somehow a benefit.</p>
    <p>It's likely that this is only going to grow in popularity as
    time goes on, but that doesn't mean I should just give up and
    like it. There's always C.</p>
