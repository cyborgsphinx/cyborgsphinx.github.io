  Personality</h1>

  <p>I come from a family of introverts. Growing up, I was told, by
  this family, that I was incredibly extroverted. I never saw
  myself that way, and passed it off as the effect of only being
  able to judge these things relatively.</p>
  <p>More recently, I’ve started to see myself as more extroverted
  than I had previously. Still not exactly an extrovert, but
  somewhere in the middle. An ambivert, if you will. And it’s
  possible that what I saw previously as solid intrversion was
  realy just depression making it hard to want to be extroverted.
  Maybe depressed extroverts present as introverts.</p>
  <p>That’s all I really have to say. No big revelation. We all
  know personality classifications are little more than horoscopes
  anyway.</p>
