    <h1>Some Thoughts on Personality</h1>
    <h2><em>12 June 2016</em></h2>
    <p>I come from a family of introverts. Growing up, I was told,
    by this family, that I was incredibly extroverted. I never saw
    myself that way, and passed it off as the effect of only being
    able to judge these things relatively.</p>
    <p>More recently, I've started to see myself as more
    extroverted than I had previously. Still not exactly an
    extrovert, but somewhere in the middle. An ambivert, if you
    will. And it's possible that what I saw previously as solid
    intrversion was realy just depression making it hard to want to
    be extroverted. Maybe depressed extroverts present as
    introverts.</p>
    <p>That's all I really have to say. No big revelation. We all
    know personality classifications are little more than
    horoscopes anyway.</p>
