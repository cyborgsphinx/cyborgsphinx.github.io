  The Difference Between Object Oriented Programming and Functional
  Programming</h1>
  <h2 id="july-2016"><em>27 July 2016</em></h2>
  <p>From what I can tell, the main difference between object
  oriented programming and functional programming is how they try
  to solve the problem of global mutable state. They both seem to
  take issue with, and fix the problems associated with, parts of
  that phrase. OOP takes issue with “global”, and solves that with
  encapsulation and everything else OOP is known for. FP takes
  issue with “global mutable state”, and solves it with an emphasis
  on pure functions that don’t mutate anything outside their own
  scope - and often not even things inside.</p>
