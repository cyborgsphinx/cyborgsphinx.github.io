Symbol Tables are Harder Than They Should Be
============================================

*10 July 2016*
--------------

A symbol table is a lookup table used in a compiler to hold information about functions and variables.
And that is about all I can say coherently on the matter.
You'd think there's at least one good overview of how to make and work with them, but I can't seem to find it.
Even the LLVM documentation just breezes over its existence.

Sure, it's not exactly central to making a compiler, but I would have expected someone to do at least a tiny introduction to them.
Maybe I'll fix that once this semester is over.
