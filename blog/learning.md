Why I Don't Use Code School
===========================

I used to use online learning sites like Code School and Codecademy to try to keep up with languages I don't use in class.
However, I often found that I came away from these sites feeling like I knew as much as when I started.
This was despite my ability to "prove" that I had made progress.

I think it comes down to how these sites attempt to teach their students.

In Code School, for instance, the problem you are given is broken down into steps.
The lesson walks you through the steps, and at the end you have completed whatever it was you were doing.

This is not how I learn.
I need to break it down myself.
That is an integral part of my process.
Breaking a problem down helps me undertand it better, and in turn helps me use the tools available in the language more effectively.
Then I can look up how to solve the smaller problems in the language, or at least a function that I think will help.
In the end, I feel I learn more that way.

The only tool I've found that does this is [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).
They give you a readme, a bunch of tests, instructions on how to set up an environment and run the tests, and bid you good luck.
And the thing is, after a few of these I feel like I can actually code in these languages.
Maybe not well, and probably not using the features that an experienced user would, but I can write solutions to interesting problems.
And that feels much more compelling than having followed a few steps and not getting a feeling as to why.
