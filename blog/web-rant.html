  <p>That title was just to get your attention. I don’t actually
  think websites suck. I do think making them does, especially for
  those starting out.</p>
  <p>You’ve got HTML, which is decent enough, but not good for
  straight up writing text in. That’s why Markdown was made, after
  all. Then there’s CSS, which is only necessary for websites as
  much as scoreboards are for sporting events. Technically
  optional, unless you’re planning on having actual people actually
  show up. So you need to know how to CSS, or at least use a
  framework like Bootstrap. But if you use Bootstrap, you wind up
  with a site that looks like it uses Boostrap. Since every startup
  since the creation of Bootstrap uses Bootstrap (slight hyperbole,
  I’m sure some use Foundation), that means your site looks like
  every other site. And everyone’s tired of looking at that.</p>
  <p>Finally, there’s everyone’s favourite part of the web
  trifecta: Javascript. Like CSS, you don’t NEED it. Unlike CSS, I
  don’t use it here. To carry on with the sports analogy,
  Javascript is like having a unique symbol for your team. Cool if
  you have it, but it won’t hurt not to. Since I don’t use it, I
  have less to say about it. I mostly just dislike it on
  principle.</p>
