  Compilers Are Only as Safe as Their Code Generation</h1>

  <p>A compiler takes text of one kind and outputs text of another
  kind that is functionally equivalent. Generally, this is done to
  produce machine code in order to make an executable. Sometimes,
  it is translating from one programming language to another. In
  both of these scenarios, the safety guarantees of the program
  often go out the window once the compiler has done its job.</p>
  <p>It’s harder to see this with the machine code version, simply
  because we don’t see the machine code. Such compilers sometimes
  add other checks directly into the machine code as well, so it’s
  not as obvious that it’s not really safer than writing it all
  yourself. But it becomes a lot more clear in the second scenario,
  speifically with compilers to JavaScript.</p>
  <p>Many compilers exist which emit JavaScript. This is because
  many people don’t want to write JavaScript. TypeScript, for
  example, is essentially a superset of JavaScript made to give
  static type checking to JavaScript. But that all goes away when
  you compile a TypeScript program into JavaScript. Specifically,
  if the TypeScript code generation emits code that isn’t well
  thought out, the result is not actually an improvement over what
  you could write yourself.</p>
  <p>CoffeeScript, another compiler to JavaScript, used to have
  this problem. I can’t say for sure whether or not it still does,
  but it used to emit code that the programmer had to fix
  afterward. This not only defeats the whole purpose of the
  compiler, but also hurts the overall safety of the code. Because
  the fix wasn’t run through some sort of checker, it has
  significantly fewer restrictions on what it can do, which may
  lead to a great deal of oddities.</p>
  <p>Once again, I don’t have anything truly profound to say about
  this. I just think it’s important enough to deserve a few
  words.</p>
