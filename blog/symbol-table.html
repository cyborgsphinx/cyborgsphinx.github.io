    <h1>Symbol Tables are Harder Than They Should Be</h1>
    <h2><em>10 July 2016</em></h2>
    <p>A symbol table is a lookup table used in a compiler to hold
    information about functions and variables. And that is about
    all I can say coherently on the matter. You'd think there's at
    least one good overview of how to make and work with them, but
    I can't seem to find it. Even the LLVM documentation just
    breezes over its existence.</p>
    <p>Sure, it's not exactly central to making a compiler, but I
    would have expected someone to do at least a tiny introduction
    to them. Maybe I'll fix that once this semester is over.</p>
