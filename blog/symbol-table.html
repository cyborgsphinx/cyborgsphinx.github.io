  <p>A symbol table is a lookup table used in a compiler to hold
  information about functions and variables. And that is about all
  I can say coherently on the matter. You’d think there’s at least
  one good overview of how to make and work with them, but I can’t
  seem to find it. Even the LLVM documentation just breezes over
  its existence.</p>
  <p>Sure, it’s not exactly central to making a compiler, but I
  would have expected someone to do at least a tiny introduction to
  them. Maybe I’ll fix that once this semester is over.</p>
