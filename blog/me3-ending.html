  <h1 id="mass-effect-3-ending">Mass Effect 3 Ending</h1>
  <h2 id="may-2016"><em>19 May 2016</em></h2>
  <p>Before playing Mass Effect 3, I had heard that the ending was
  a let down. Recently, I finished it and found the ending to fit
  well within the story.</p>
  <p>If you didn’t already know, Mass Effect 3 is a video game. As
  you may have guessed, it is the third game in a series, whose
  title is Mass Effect. At its core, the game is about choices.
  Hard choices. The kind of choices we don’t want to have to make.
  Peppered throughout are choices that are easier to make, and
  generally have to do with playing a role the player has in their
  head. However, now and then a much larger choice comes along, and
  forces the player to really sit down and think about what they’re
  doing.</p>
  <p>One such choice is whether to destroy or modify some synthetic
  life forms who have formed beliefs based on a floating point
  rounding error. That was an acutal thing in an actual game. But
  the choice itself is basically between changing some living
  beings so that they think in a way that you want them to, or
  killing them. Neither option really appeals. But this choice is
  there, and it’s practically designed to be divisive. It’s a
  significant moral dilemma - do you kill someone for not believing
  what you do, or do you change their mind without them knowing or
  wanting you to? It should be mentioned at this point that leaving
  them alone is not really an option. Not only because the game
  won’t let you, but also because they have become violent due to
  their beliefs and have attacked those who disagree. So something
  needs to be done, otherwise innocent people will get hurt.</p>
  <p>The choice in the ending to Mass Effect 3 is fairly well
  related to the one above. Briefly, a race of overpowered
  synthetic life forms called Reapers are threatening to destroy
  all advanced life in the galaxy, and you can stop them in one of
  three ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Destroy: you can destroy not only them, but all synthetic
    life in the galaxy,</li>
    <li>Control: you can assume direct control over the machines
    threatening harm,</li>
    <li>Synthesis: you can make every living thing in the galaxy a
    hybrid of synthetic and organic life.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These all have their own moral dilemmas, but again not
  choosing isn’t really an option because of the intent of the
  Reapers. I’m not going to say which one is best, because they can
  all be backed by good reasons, at least from the point of view of
  the player character. However, I think this kind of ending fits
  well within the Mass Effect series due to its difficulty to
  answer well.</p>
  <p>Personally, I think synthesis is the best solution to the
  problem.</p>
