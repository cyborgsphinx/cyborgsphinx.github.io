  Motivation App</h1>

  <p>Some people have no problem finding motivation. Often their
  motivation is intrinsic; they simply enjoy doing what they’re
  supposed to. Other people have more trouble finding the
  motivation, even if it’s something they want to do. These are not
  mutually exclusive, as one person’s motivation can be very
  different between different actions.</p>
  <p>I have long had difficulty finding motivation to go outside
  and exercise. Even when I want to, even when I know I’ll enjoy
  it, it can be hard to find the right motivation at the right time
  to do it. Enter Pokemon Go. It has given me a reason to do
  exactly what I want to be doing anyway.</p>
  <p>It’s not that I want to stay inside and stare at screens all
  day. In fact, I know that’s not good for me. But I couldn’t
  motivate myself to go out very easily before. It’s easier when I
  can use that to do something else I’ll enjoy. Like collecting
  Pokemon.</p>
  <p>If only it didn’t come out in the latter half of the semester,
  when I needed to focus on all my assignments. Oh well, better
  late than never, right?</p>
