  Limitations</h1>
  <h2 id="may-2016"><em>25 May 2016</em></h2>
  <p>Mark Rosewater, head designer for Magic the Gathering, likes
  to say that limitations breed creativity. Or something like that.
  I can’t seem to find a source on that one for some reason.</p>
  <p>But anyway, limitations. I’m somewhat skeptical of this
  notion, not just because I generally dislike limiting myself. It
  is my experience that creativity is spontaneously generated, and
  that everything after the spark is just hard work. What some see
  as creativity may just be testing the limits given and trying to
  come up with some solution that fits.</p>
  <p>Limitatins do have value, however. If they didn’t it’s likely
  that we wouldn’t put them on everything. The benefit given my
  limitations, however, is more about getting results. If you have
  a limit, whether on time or content or something else entirely,
  it is easier for you to present some sort of result. This is why
  exams and assignments have time limits. If there was no limit,
  the eventual result would possibly be the most creative product
  possible. However, it is just as likely that it never sees the
  light of day.</p>
  <p>Limitations remove the problem some people have with a blank
  canvas or an empty page. Those represent all possible outcomes,
  and anything is possible when they stay that way. But when some
  constraint is put on them, it makes it easier to move forward
  with a particular project.</p>
  <p>This is why most people try to come up with some constraint
  for any project where the instructor gives none; we all know it’s
  easier to move forward when some decisions have already been
  made. It is certainly harder to keep comeing up with content for
  a blog that has no set content requirements. I just like keeping
  my options open, especially when I can easily get bored of
  topics.</p>
