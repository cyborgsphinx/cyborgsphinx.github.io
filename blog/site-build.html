  <h2 id="may-2016"><em>13 May 2016</em></h2>
  <p>So last time I talked about how annoyed I am about working
  with websites. But I made this, clearly, so I must have found a
  way to deal with things. That’s what this post is about.</p>
  <p>So first of all, I don’t have many needs in relation to the
  HTML beyond text, so I use Markdown to write the text you see.
  But I do need a few things at the head at foot of each page,
  which I have templates to insert into each page as needed. These
  are really simple templates, just with a link to the CSS I use
  for the site and the links at the top and bottom of the
  pages.</p>
  <p>It turns out that if you use relative paths for links, they
  work when online but not as local files. It is entirely possible
  to look at each page individually, and only test that links are
  correct when the site is put online, but I’m lazy and would
  prefer to just click links to check each page. So I needed to use
  relative paths so I could verify locally and on the web.</p>
  <p>Keeping all this straight is a little rough at times, so I
  wrote a build script to make everything work. But the site kept
  growing, and I needed to make sure the script got called on every
  file. But then it kept growing, and I didn’t want to run the
  script on every file each time I updated one.</p>
  <p>Enter Make. I wrote a makefile from scratch for the first time
  for this site, and it was an adventure. Make’s syntax is fairly
  strange if you don’t understand where it comes from, and at this
  point in time that describes a lot of people, myself included. So
  I’m probably not taking advantage of the features I should in
  order to make my life easier, but it works well enough at the
  moment. After a while, however, the same could not be said about
  my build script.</p>
  <p>The script was originally made in Bash, with some
  modifications over time to build everything at once, then back to
  one at a time when Make was introduced. But this didn’t do quite
  what I wanted, which for a tinkerer means it needs to go. I
  needed more logic than I could get with my knowledge of Bash, and
  even if I managed it wasn’t going to be pretty.</p>
  <p>Rewriting the whole thing in Python was easier than I thought
  it would be at first. I was a little nervous at first, as there
  were a few external commands that I needed to run and it’s a lot
  simpler to do those with bash, but making them work in Python
  wasn’t too much work. Overall, the change was positive because it
  allowed me to specify what I wanted more easily. The addition of
  types beyond strings didn’t hurt either.</p>
  <p>So that’s how this site is built, as well as a bit of history
  as to why. Overall, making a usable website isn’t the worst thing
  with the right tools.</p>
