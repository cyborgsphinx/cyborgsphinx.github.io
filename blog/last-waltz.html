  Waltz</h1>
  <h2 id="july-2016"><em>9 July 2016</em></h2>
  <p>I recently learned how to waltz with a few hundred of my close
  personal friends in downtown Vancouver. I say learned, but it’s
  only really learned if writing Hello World and Fizz Buzz means
  you’ve learned programming. I now know how a waltz generally
  works, and can (probably) not look like a complete idiot if it
  ever comes up again, but I’m nowhere near putting it on my CV. It
  was fun, though.</p>
