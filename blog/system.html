  Too Easy</h1>
  <h2 id="july-2016"><em>2 July 2016</em></h2>
  <p>Since the beginning of the summer, I have been running Ubuntu
  16.04 as my main Linux environment. And I must say, it’s getting
  pretty boring.</p>
  <p>I started my dive into Linux and Unix with Fedora, the
  community offering by Red Hat. Eventually, I moved to Arch, a DIY
  distro that assumes nothing about its users. And after years of
  those being how I interact with my computer, Ubuntu just feels
  boring.</p>
  <p>The only I’ve updated in the past week has been NeoVim, which
  I got through a PPA. The Unity desktop environment is good enough
  to do mostly what I want a full DE to do. I haven’t bothered with
  really setting up a tiling window manager, because I have better
  things to do with my time. But that’s the thing - just last year,
  that WAS what I wanted to spend my time on.</p>
  <p>This summer, I am pretty busy. Three courses during a time
  when I am normally taking none will do that. So I really
  shouldn’t be spending a lot of time on tweaking my environment
  anyway. But I’m so used to doing it that it feels weird not
  to.</p>
  <p>The only problem I’ve run into has been difficulty with
  installing Steam. But I haven’t purged my machine of Windows yet,
  so that’s not really an issue either.</p>
