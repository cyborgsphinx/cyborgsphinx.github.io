  <h1 id="job-inteviewers-ask-bad-questions">Job Inteviewers Ask
  Bad Questions</h1>
  <h2 id="may-2016"><em>27 May 2016</em></h2>
  <p>A lot of people in these kinds of posts rant about being asked
  technical questions for technical jobs. Like inverting a binary
  tree; most of these questions are actually relatively easy as
  long as you know the fundamentals of what you’re using. Those
  aren’t the kinds of questions that I am frustrated by, because I
  actually know how to think. The question that gets to me is “Tell
  us about yourself”. Not technically a question, I know, but it
  requires an answer so I’m counting it.</p>
  <p>This gets to me because I don’t like to talk about myself. I’m
  not in business for a reason. I came into the job interview for a
  job to do a thing. I would prefer to actually talk about doing
  that thing, not have to make up a personality that fits with the
  vision of my potential employers.</p>
  <p>It is possible to prepare an answer for that one, true, but
  this comes back to my main issue with it - I don’t see it as
  relevant to the actual job. I can understand a desire to ensure
  that a candidate has the skills required for the job, but I don’t
  think asking them to invent a story in which they do is the way
  to go about it. This also applies to other questions about more
  general, less quantifiable skills. Since those skills are harder
  to define, it is sometimes enticing to offload the need to
  identify them to the candidate by having them answer a question
  that might guide the candidate toward their desired answer. This
  is lazy thinking, which is porbably why it has continued to be
  used. Lazy people do less work at once, allowing them to work
  longer, and move up the ranks. But this isn’t a good reason to
  keep it going. Forcing someone else to tell you their qualities
  is possibly the least reliable method of getting them. People can
  lie. People can overestimate their abilities. People can also
  underestimate their abilities. All of these mean that asking
  people to tell you about themselves is not going to give you an
  accurate picture of them. It will give you a picture biased
  toward their opinions, which is likely not what you want. I’m not
  sure what the best way to find these things out is, but it is not
  asking candidates to tell you about themselves.</p>
