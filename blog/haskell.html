  Functional May Not Be the Right Word for Haskell</h1>
  <h2 id="aug-2016"><em>1 Aug 2016</em></h2>
  <p>Haskell is a functional programming language. Nobody can claim
  it isn’t. It uses functions to do things, avoids affecting global
  mutable state, and generally embodies everything about functional
  programming.</p>
  <p>Except, it also embodies so much more.</p>
  <p>Static typing isn’t required for functional programming; most
  common functional languages aren’t static. Heck, a lot don’t have
  pervasive type systems. All Lisp dialects, as well as Erlang,
  lack this feature. So Haskell is something more than just a
  functional language.</p>
  <p>Think about it like this: Java is an object-oriented language.
  I don’t think there is a doubt in anyone’s mind that Java is
  object-oriented. Describing it as procedural seems wrong in some
  way. But at the core, Java code looks a heckuva lot like C++
  code. And C++, while being many things, is procedural. So while
  Java often looks like code that could be called procedural, it is
  something else. That’s what I’m trying to say about Haskell.</p>
  <p>Haskell is more about types than anything else. The reason to
  use Haskell, beyond curiosity, is that its type system is very
  powerful. Haskell’s type system is one of the most strict type
  systems you will find, but is also incredibly robust. Haskell
  showcases what can be done with type systems.</p>
  <p>What I’m trying to say is that Haskell seems more like a
  type-oriented language than a funcitonal one. If you just wanted
  to pick up a functional language, after all, Clojure is a lot
  easier to learn.</p>
