  <h1 id="llvm-needs-better-documentation">LLVM Needs Better
  Documentation</h1>
  <h2 id="july-2016"><em>14 July 2016</em></h2>
  <p>I have been writing a compiler over the course of this
  semester for a class. The compiler emits LLVM IR, or intermediate
  representation, which is then compiled by the LLVM assembler into
  machine code that runs on the computer. To do this, instead of
  algorithmically working out the text that should be in the output
  file, I am using LLVM’s C++ API. And the documentation for this
  API is abysmal.</p>
  <p>The docs are automatically generated by Doxygen, which I don’t
  think actually has a negative impact. I’m willing to believe that
  if they weren’t automatically generated, they wouldn’t exist. But
  the content isn’t much better than just a list of classes,
  methods, and associated functions.</p>
  <p>To start, there isn’t a search box. There is no way to search
  the docs without using another search engine. I don’t know if
  this is a thing Doxygen can do, but it’s really a requirement for
  an API this big.</p>
  <p>Once you find the page you need, there’s a flow chart of
  inheritence involving the class. This flow chart contains both
  classes the current class inherits from, and what those inherit
  from and so on, as well as which classes inherit from it, and
  what inherits from those and so on. None of this information is
  actually useful unless I need to navigate to another class and I
  happen to know its place in the diagram. The chart could really
  be at the bottom of the page. Again, likely more Doxygen’s fault
  than LLVM’s, but again, LLVM is big enough that this matters.</p>
  <p>Once the user scrolls passed the flow chart, there’s a list of
  methods and associated functions. Finally, useful information.
  But the only documentation these functions get is their name, the
  names and types of their arguments (many of which are non-obvious
  abbreviations), and maybe - MAYBE - a single line giving a vague
  idea of what the function might do. Sometimes that’s enough, far
  too often it doesn’t come close.</p>
  <p>Clicking the name of the function jumps the page down to the
  more in-depth description of what the function does. Nothing
  about the function headder changes, except for how it is
  presented. The extra whitespace is nice, but not exactly helpful.
  The text underneath, if it exists, has whatever was there
  previously, as well as the line on which the function is
  declared. It doesn’t even tell you where it is defined. It links
  to a header file, which contains exactly the same information
  that everything already seen has.</p>
  <p>The whole documentation leads to using the lists of functions
  to guess what to do. I’m not reading documentation to guess.
  Forcing a user to guess how to use your API is a failure of your
  documentation.</p>
  <p>I mean, I’ve been successful so far. But I’m clever, so that
  doesn’t count.</p>
