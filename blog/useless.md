Why I'm Not Exactly Amazed at Yacc
==================================

*17 June 2016*

I was told today that were I around writing compilers in the 70's, I would be grateful for Yacc.
This came up because I was complaining about yacc within earshot of someone who knows what they're talking about.
And I don't doubt it.
The thing is, this isn't the 70's.
And I don't know context-free grammars as well as I probably should.
But I am trying to use yacc, so I would like it if yacc produced warnings more useful than "this rule is useless" without any context.
I know it's a context-free grammar, but still.
I would at least like to know why this warning was produced, so I can write rules that are a little bit useful.

If you say my rules are useless, I'm assuming you know why.
If you tell me why, I can make rules that are less useless.
Even if I know exactly what I'm doing, it is likely that I put that rule in because I expected it to be useful, so telling me why it's useless is a benefit anyway.
