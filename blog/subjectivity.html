  Objective Facts and Why Your Opinion is Not One</h1>
  <h2 id="june-2016"><em>3 June 2016</em></h2>
  <p>My high school music teacher impressed upon us one very
  important fact in the first class: You don’t know enough to know
  whether music is good or not. Any time someone says that a song
  is “bad” or even that a genre “sucks”, they are expressing their
  subjective opinion as if it were a fact. It is not a fact. They
  likely don’t know enough about music to actually know whether or
  not anything is technically good. All they can tell is whether or
  not they like it.</p>
  <p>This comes up in technical circles more than I would like.
  People spout their opinions on programming languages or
  frameworks or paradigms as though they are objective fact despite
  being solely opinion. These opinions may not even be those of the
  people expressing them. I’ve come across people who will express
  an opinion but have no real reason to back it up. I’ve even had
  that happen to me. And It is often because these people just took
  someone else’s opinion and decided to roll with it. Then they
  have this opinion that they will defend to the death without
  having any idea why.</p>
  <p>I’d love to offer a solution to this, but I can’t come up with
  one outside of “actually understand the difference between fact
  an opinion”. Which would definitely solve the issue, but it isn’t
  exactly easy to do.</p>
