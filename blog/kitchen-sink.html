  Approach is Bad Design</h1>
  <h2 id="june-2016"><em>22 June 2016</em></h2>
  <p>When designing a programming language, it is tempting to put
  in everything that is thought to be useful. This approach is bad.
  It doesn’t help make your language more usable. It doesn’t help
  your users solve more problems. It just creates a lot of
  technical debt right off the bat.</p>
  <p>When I started to learn Ruby, I used for loops to iterate
  across arrays. This is because the <code>for</code> loop is the
  idiomatic way to iterate through linear collections (lists,
  arrays, vectors, etc.) in languages that have them. After a
  while, I learned that this is not the case in Ruby.</p>
  <p>There are two ways (at least) to do pretty much the same thing
  in Ruby: the <code>for</code> loop, and the <code>each</code>
  method. The main difference, as was told to me, is that the
  <code>each</code> method creates a scope separate from the
  enclosing scope, in which you don’t have access to the outer
  scope. This means that if you have a variable inside the
  <code>each</code> method’s block that has the same name as one
  outside, the two are separate variables. This is not the case in
  a <code>for</code> loop.</p>
  <p>Because there are two ways to do the same thing, I needed
  guidance. The community said to use the <code>each</code> method,
  citing mainly what I said above. This is a terrible reason. In
  fact, using the same reason, I assert that using a
  <code>for</code> loop should be preferred.</p>
  <p>There are two cases to consider: when the difference in scope
  makes no difference, and when it matters. When it makes no
  difference, programmers who have used any other language that is
  at all similar will reach for the <code>for</code> loop. It’s
  what they’re used to. It’s universal. It’s idiomatic. The
  <code>each</code> method is only really in Ruby, and will only
  cause confusion when someone new comes along. When it matters,
  you shouldn’t code yourself into a trap of shadowing a variable
  unless that’s what you meant. If you don’t want things inside
  your loop to affect things outside your loop, don’t give them the
  same name. Again, this will help those who are coming to your
  language from another one. Other languages don’t have the
  seemingly arbitrary scoping rules that allow you to give two
  different variables the same name and have them not interact. So
  introducing it makes your language harder to learn without really
  offering benefits.</p>
  <p>If I didn’t want my variable to affect the one outside its
  scope, I would have named it something else.</p>
