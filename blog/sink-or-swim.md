Sink or Swim is a Bad Way to Teach
==================================

*30 July 2016*
--------------

"Sink or swim" refers to the notion of tossing someone in a pool or lake in order to quickly discern whether or not they can swim.
Some lazy thinkers have taken that as a way to teach, as well.
Even in the metaphorical sense, it works much better as a testing method than a teaching one.

When you're teaching someone, they likely need guidance of some sort in order to learn.
That's the whole point of teaching.
If nobody ever needed guidance, the education system would look very different.
Heck, it would be radically changed if most people didn't need help.

Trying to teach with sink or swim is likely to be detrimental to the student, and very possibly everything they do in the future.
This is especially true in tech.
If we give up on mentors and just have people figure everything out for themselves, we'll wind up with substantially inferior software.
It's just not a reasonable way to do things.

Now, as a testing method, it makes much more sense.
Heck, it's basically what happens on final exams.
You're given a bunch of questions, minimal outside help, a pat on the shoulder, and a hearty "good luck".
At least one of those was figurative.

The point is, you don't teach using only tests.
So you shouldn't teach by throwing people in the deep end and hoping for the best.
