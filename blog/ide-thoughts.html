  <p>I’m not a fan of IDEs. They don’t do it for me. There’s
  nothing they can do that can’t be done by something else, and the
  other offering is often at least more flexible.</p>
  <p>Editing code is easy if you understand the editor you’re
  using. This is true of IDEs as well, but they’re often so big and
  bulky that it’s harder to learn just the editing bits. Having a
  light-weight editor that just wants to let you write to a file is
  good because it allows the programmer’s own style and influence
  come across. In an IDE with code generation, this can get lost in
  the noise. As well, it is hard to generate code that works the
  first time, every time. This is why compilers are still complex
  things that few people want to work on. Introducing that amount
  of complexity into editing text seems like overkill for most
  things.</p>
  <p>IDEs tend to be less portable than editors, too. What you
  learn in an IDE is often specific to that IDE, and your
  configuration can’t travel with you either. They also expect
  projects and directories to be built in specific ways, that often
  are unique to the IDE itself.</p>
  <p>Overall, I find IDEs to be incredibly difficult to work with,
  and wind up just making it harder to do what I wanted to. Except
  ones made by JetBrains. Those guys know what they’re doing when
  it comes to making an IDE that gets out of the way.</p>
