    <h1>About Me </h1>

    <p>I am a student at Simon Fraser University studying computing science who tends to prefer the lower levels of the field. This is an attempt to learn the languages and tools that make up the higher end, specifically web delevopment and all that entails. So this site is really about me making mistakes and trying to learn why people like to automate things so much.</p>
