<h1>This is an experiment in web development </h1>

<p>So I decided that using tools like Jekyll to generate this was not quite as fun as they could be. 
This has led to the decision to scrap it all and just write this whole thing myself. 
It's not like this has much traffic generated anyway, I'm really just using it to practice/learn HTML and CSS.</p>
