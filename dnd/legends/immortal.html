  <p>Long ago, there was a group of students studying the
  necromantic arts who were researching how to extend life
  indefinitely. They achieved more than anyone believed possible,
  eventually discovering how to avoid death entirely. However, the
  power was too much for them to control, and all but one lost
  their lives in the ritual. The sole survivor did become immortal,
  having unknowingly used the others’ lives as sacrifices.</p>
  <p>She got more than she expected, too. Sickness would not take
  her, and she could not be wounded in any way. While all around
  her eventually went to meet the Raven Queen, she remained in the
  material world. She was held in a sort of statis in which she did
  not age, needing neither sustenance nor rest.</p>
  <p>The time she now had drove her to the brink of insanity on
  more than one occasion, until she learned from the elves how to
  manage having so much to spare. They taught her to walk the
  world, to take pleasure in all the life she could take in. The
  travel would ease her mind, help her forget for a moment the
  burden of a life lived too long.</p>
  <p>It was during her travels that she came across a creature of
  powerful magic. This creature, what would now be called a Lich,
  could tell immediately that something was amiss. He demanded that
  she submit to him, and retrieve a hoard of gems hiddin in a
  volcano, an act only someone like her could perform. When she
  refused, he cursed her to eternal slumber, only waking up when he
  had a command to give. The curse also bound her to the volcano,
  the location most prominent in his mind. Unable to protect
  herself from the magic as it was performed, and powerless to undo
  it once it took hold, she was forced to fetch the gems and await
  further commands. When her tasks were done, she took to making a
  home out of the volcano she was first tasked with entering.</p>
  <p>This went on for many years, which passed with many similar
  impossible tasks. One such task saw her sink into the ocean to
  wrest a sword from the merfolk who lived there, again for the
  Lich’s benefit. She was used as the Lich’s enforcement, and his
  supplier.</p>
  <p>The Lich thought himself clever, having found a servant who
  was only around when he needed her. However, the way he
  communicated his desires had to be communicated through a ritual.
  This ritual, and the time it took her to find him when she was
  summoned, meant that he had to plan farther in advance than he
  was wont to do.</p>
  <p>One day, after centuries of subjugation had passed, a group of
  adventurers known only as The Party stormed his tower, the
  Immortal in tow. It turned out that the summoning ritual was not
  one only he could perform, and their ranger had been watching him
  for quite some time. They had commanded her to aid them in
  killing him, ensuring that she could not be used against
  them.</p>
  <p>The battle was long-fought, for even without his invulnerable
  servant, the Lich was incredibly powerful. The Party prevailed,
  however, and the Lich was slain. But the Immortal still felt the
  draw to the volcano, still felt the weight of the curse upon her.
  She bid The Party farewell, and left. She walked back to the
  volcano this time, feeling no need to hurry with the Lich dead.
  If she could, she would undo what he had done to the world. But
  the curse forbade her from taking any action other than traveling
  to and from the volcano without a command.</p>
  <p>The ritual for her summoning became a closely guarded secret
  among The Party, only being passed on when the new member had
  gained enough trust. They wanted to ensure that the Immortal was
  not used in the same way that the Lich had been using her. As
  with all secrets, however, this one proved impossible to keep
  forever.</p>
  <p>A greiving widow once performed the ritual by accident, and
  was surprised when the Immortal showed up on her doorstep. She
  asked the Immortal to retrieve her four sons, so she could have
  some comfort. The Immortal was glad to be used for good after all
  the evil she had been forced to perform.</p>
  <p>The first son was mayor of a town in the kingdom of Mivol, a
  shrewd politician who could make sure what he wanted got done. He
  did not want to leave, enjoying his power too much. The Immortal,
  bound by the curse, took him by the shoulder and dragged him back
  to his mother.</p>
  <p>The second son was a head priest of a temple dedicated to the
  worship of Pelor, a charismatic man who could convince anyone to
  see his side of things. He showed remorse for not being there,
  but declared that his temple needed him more than his mother did.
  Besides, she had his brother. The Immortal tossed him over her
  shoulder and carried him back, the curse ensuring that his
  arguments fell on deaf ears.</p>
  <p>The third son was a general in the armies of Mivol,
  responsible for the lives of an army of soldiers and innumerable
  townsfolk. He could not leave his post, lest the army fall into
  chaos and the people suffer. When the Immortal was not wavering,
  he retreated and ordered his men to apprehend her, but their
  weapons could not pierce her skin as she advanced, cornering him.
  Seeing this display, he reluctantly agreed to go with her,
  tasking a subordinate with his role.</p>
  <p>The final son was a simple man, living a life in provincial
  Mivol with his wife and children. He agreed that he should go
  back to help his mother, asking only that his family be brough
  along as well. The Immortal agreed, allowing him to pack up his
  things and head out the next day. She opted to walk the whole
  way, having used her extensive magical abilities to quicken the
  return trip every other time. The journey back was much more
  enjoyable than the last three, and the man and his wife made for
  pleasant company.</p>
  <p>When they arrived at the widow’s house, it was nearly in ruins
  from the fighting happening within. The final son merely smirked,
  rolled his eyes, and made a comment about family before opening
  the door and announcing his presence.</p>
  <p>With her task complete, the Immortal headed back to the
  volcano, now known as Big Rock Mountain. And to this day she
  sleeps, bound by the curse to wait for the next summoning.</p>
