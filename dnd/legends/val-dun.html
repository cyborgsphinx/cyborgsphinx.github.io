  <p>Val’dun had always wanted to study the arcane arts. This was a
  pursuit normally limited to those blessed with control over the
  Weave since birth, or with enough command over words that reality
  distorted itself to make them true. Val’dun wanted to be able to
  explore this pursuit himself, and allow others to follow.</p>
  <p>But he was coming up against a problem – there was far too
  much to keep in his head. Everything involved in casting even one
  spell took a great deal of effort to remember, and he wanted to
  learn them all. His contemporaries relied on constantly
  forgetting and relearning how to manipulate the Weave to perform
  as they desired, keeping these spells alive in a distributed
  network. But Val’dun wanted to take his spells away from the
  sanctuary; he wanted to please a crowd the way the bards did, or
  be as renowned for his prowess as the sorcerers.</p>
  <p>One day, he came across a bard telling a tale he’d heard many
  times over, but there was something different about this telling.
  The bard was reading from a book! Val’dun looked about the crowd,
  and all were as enamored with this telling as they were any other
  he had seen. Settling back in to listening, Val’dun determined
  that the story held just as much power after being written as it
  did when performed from memory.</p>
  <p>It would be great if he could write down how to affect the
  Weave, just as that bard had his tale, so as to keep that
  knowledge in a vessel more readily available and permanent than
  another person. But it was the common belief that magic was less
  effective when written down – just look at the sorcerers, they
  don’t carry around heavy tomes. The bards keep it all in their
  memory, how hard can it be? The clerics and druids, capable of
  affecting the world in a manner that was different but just as
  powerful, just as real, merely prayed or meditated to reatin
  their power. No spells were ever written, and the conclusion was
  that they would lose potency if they were.</p>
  <p>Val’dun took exception to this reasoning; it was not proven
  that the spells MUST lose power. The only reason he could find as
  to why nobody wrote spells down was that nobody wrote spells
  down. It frustrated him to no end, especially after his time with
  the bard who wrote things down, so he began saving up the
  resources necessary to properly test the thought.</p>
  <p>As soon as he had the necessary funds, he bought a tome and
  some ink. He copied down a single spell, the one used to
  determine whether objects in an area have been affected by the
  Weave, and made efforts to forget it. Coming back a week later,
  with many other spells filled in his head, he read from the book
  and copied the actions. As soon as he had finished, the familiar
  visual tones of the Detect Magic spell suffused his vision,
  allowing him to see all that was magical around himself. The
  spell had not lost its potency for having been written down.</p>
  <p>After that, he write feverishly in his book. Every spell he
  knew, and any he was taught over the following month, wound up in
  its pages. He was so excited that he even copied the spells that
  were easy to remember, the simple ones that made objects glow or
  allowed messages to be sent.</p>
  <p>The problem, however, was proving his work to his colleagues.
  A great deal of his magic was centered around himself, augmenting
  his powers or granting himself additional capabilities. Those
  that weren’t were combat-oriented, and he did not wish to harm
  his audience just to prove a point. He did manage to find a few
  that affected the world outside him, but were also not harmful.
  They would have to do.</p>
