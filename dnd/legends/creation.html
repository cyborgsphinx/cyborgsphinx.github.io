  <p>Remember – this is what people believe, not what is</p>
  <p>Each of the outer planes exists on the shore of the Sea,
  having grown from the original four: Elysium, Limbo, Hades, and
  Mechanus. These four planes were like fonts, their powers of
  Good, Chaos, Evil, and Law flowing from them into the Sea to
  create combined planes along the shores. Their powers also mixed
  in the middle, finding an island made of all four elements and
  suffusing it with the power to create life. From on this island
  grew a large tree, engulfing the entirety of the land mass.</p>
  <p>As life grew and changed in and around the tree, the dead and
  dying fell to the lower branches, and eventually the roots. This
  is the Shadowfell – the unchanging realm of death.</p>
  <p>The tree, reaching ever higher, has the most growth at the
  top. The leaves eventually became the home of myriad forms of
  life, living together and clashing at once. This is the Feywild –
  the ever changing garden of material life.</p>
  <p>Within the trunk of the tree, a world began to form, suspended
  within the bark, protected. It was lifeless and barren, having no
  access to the light and elements so abundant outside the confines
  of the trunk. That is, until a meteor flew from the elemental
  chaos into the tree, cracking its shell and producing the first
  twinkle of light inside. Over time, many more meteors buffetted
  the tree, causing a great deal of holes allowing light to get in.
  One meteor did more than crack the trunk, but smashed right
  through and began to orbit the world within. Eventually, two more
  followed – one a burning ball of fire, large and bright, bringing
  more light than could ever be ushered through the cracks, and one
  a mess of water that shattered once it breached the bark,
  splashing across the world.</p>
  <p>With this, the elements were thrust upon the world, and it was
  ready to carry life. It was not until four more meteors, each
  sent from the Original Planes, crashed through the tree and
  struck the world within that the spark of creation ignited
  it.</p>
  <p>The tree, ever a living thing itself, steadily repairs the
  holes these meteors cause, protecting the world within from too
  much influence of those without. But it is not the perfect shell,
  and extra-planar beings who covet the power that comes from
  combining the extremes of the elements with the extremes of
  alignment occasionally vie for dominion.</p>
