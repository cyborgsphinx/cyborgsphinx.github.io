  <p>The Party was a group of adventurers who traveled throughout
  the continent of Thune. They fought dragons, felled empires, and
  still managed to help out small townsfolk in any city they
  visited. The people loved them, the tyrants feared them, it
  seemed that all was right in the world as long as they stayed
  around. Their faces changed as the years went by, a fallen dwarf
  replaced by a gnome, an aging human making room for a fresh-faced
  elf. But the name remained, for every member kept true to the
  values of the original group.</p>
  <p>At one point, they even challenged the ascent of Vecna to
  godhood, saving the entire multiverse from what could only have
  been centuries of conflict. In the process, they freed an
  immortal from being Vecnaâ€™s slave, but they could not break the
  curse forcing her to follow any command given.</p>
  <p>It is said that they could only be defeated by a god, who
  caused a rock slide which crushed not only them but the entire
  city beneath Mount Grimm. Some believe that The Party endures to
  this day, however, since the bodies were never recovered from the
  base of the mountain.</p>
