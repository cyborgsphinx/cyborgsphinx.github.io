  <h2 id="aasimar">Aasimar</h2>
  <p>Borne of celestial heritage, aasimar are rare among the races
  of Thune. This rarity means that many do not know how to respond
  to seeing one; fear and hatred are most common.</p>
  <h2 id="dragonborn">Dragonborn</h2>
  <p>The dragonborn have a long and storied history, or so they
  would tell you. Their empire on the south of the continent is a
  recent thing, but these creatures are certain it will last until
  Tiamat returns, at least.</p>
  <h2 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h2>
  <p>Dwarves are rare among the races in Thune, the only known
  settlement being Kazundar. The only city left in the remnants of
  this once great kingdom, Magleth, is still a bustling metropolis.
  Whispers tell of a terrible secret as to why.</p>
  <h2 id="elves">Elves</h2>
  <p>The elves of Thune are content to build small settlements in
  the forests dotting the continent, not at all hurried to make
  civilization happen. It is said they guard the entrances to the
  Feywild and the Shadowfel, though many are uncertain such places
  even exist.</p>
  <h2 id="gnomes">Gnomes</h2>
  <p>Gnomes are almost as rare as dwarves, and certainly have not
  left as large a mark on any map. They can be found throughout the
  continent, and their tinkering is very helpful to the people of
  any nearby city.</p>
  <h2 id="half-elves">Half-elves</h2>
  <p>Half-elves are the result of elves leaving their homes in the
  forest and covorting with humans. They have no society unto
  themselves, trying to take on that of a parent.</p>
  <h2 id="half-orcs">Half-orcs</h2>
  <p>Half-orcs are similar to half-elves in that they have no
  society of their own. However, they are more easily accepted into
  their parentâ€™s orc tribes than half-elves are to elven
  civilizations, though their integration into human societies is
  more difficult.</p>
  <h2 id="halflings">Halflings</h2>
  <p>The halflings do not have a kingdom to call their own, but a
  few reasonably sized settlements can be found dotting the
  continent. Though their territory is not in a state of expansion,
  neither is it in decline. They seem to be able to survive a great
  deal of adversity that would eliminate a larger kingdom of a
  different race.</p>
  <h2 id="humans">Humans</h2>
  <p>Humans are the most diverse and youngest of the races on
  Thune, having made settlements all over the place. Their kingdom
  of Mivol is one of the more successful kingdoms in recent memory,
  but they can be found all over the continent doing what they can
  to get by.</p>
  <h2 id="tieflings">Tieflings</h2>
  <p>Tieflings are the result of infernal influence, whether a
  devil was directly involved or the parents have some association
  with the hells. They have no society of their own, and can find
  it difficult to find a place in preexisting ones.</p>
