  <h2 id="the-raven-queen">The Raven Queen</h2>
  <p>The Raven Queen is the goddess of fate and death. She is
  relatively new to godhood, and many are unsure about her.
  However, she seems for the most part content with shepparding the
  dead on their way to the afterlife, occasionally taking interest
  in the journey of especially powerful mortals.</p>
  <p>She strongly opposes any attempts to thwart fate, particularly
  attempts to prolong life unnaturally. The undead are seen as a
  plague that must be purged from the multiverse. As such, Chemosh
  and Orcus are among her most hated foes.</p>
  <h2 id="chemosh">Chemosh</h2>
  <p>Chemosh is the god of the undead. He has been reduced in power
  in recent years through the efforts of the Raven Queen and her
  followers, though the Cult of Gulthias intends to help him regain
  his power. He uses Orcus to further his goals on the multiverse
  until he can stand against the Matron of Ravens once again.</p>
  <h2 id="bahamut">Bahamut</h2>
  <p>Bahamut is the dragon god of good and metalic dragons. He is
  among the oldest of the gods, having bound Tiamat to the Nine
  Hells in order to restrict her power.</p>
  <h2 id="tiamat">Tiamat</h2>
  <p>Tiamat is the goddess of evil and chromatic dragons. She was
  born at the same time as Bahamut, though her deeds have led to
  her being bound to the first layer of the Nine Hells without an
  escape. She plots her revenge in order to wile away the time.</p>
  <h2 id="pelor">Pelor</h2>
  <p>Pelor is the god of the sun. He is worshiped primarily in
  Mivoll, the human kingdom on the north-east of Thune.</p>
  <h2 id="selune">Selune</h2>
  <p>Selune is the goddess of the moon. She is worshiped alongside
  Pelor, in the quieter parts of Mivoll.</p>
  <h2 id="olladra">Olladra</h2>
  <p>Olladra is the goddess of good fortune. She is the primary
  patron of Kazundar, and the namesake of the city-state
  Olladria.</p>
  <h2 id="kol">Kol</h2>
  <p>Kol Korran is the god of trade. He is worshiped in Kazundar,
  and shrines dedicated to him can be found along all the major
  trade routes in the west of Thune.</p>
  <h2 id="eadro">Eadro</h2>
  <p>Eadro is the merfolk deity of the sea. Their worship is a
  recent development in Thune, brought about by the emergence of
  legged merfolk in the Shattered Jungle. They are also worthiped
  by the tritons, a race that has a more established presence along
  the coasts.</p>
  <h2 id="skerrit">Skerrit</h2>
  <p>Skerrit is the centaur god of the hunt. Though Thune does not
  have an overly large centaur population, Skerrit has made himself
  known to enough people to gather a following throughout Thune. He
  is most well known in the Savage Belt, where he can roam
  freely.</p>
  <h2 id="tempus">Tempus</h2>
  <p>Tempus is the god of war.</p>
  <h2 id="eldath">Eldath</h2>
  <p>Eldath is the goddess of peace.</p>
  <h2 id="ilmater">Ilmater</h2>
  <p>Ilmater is the god of endurance.</p>
